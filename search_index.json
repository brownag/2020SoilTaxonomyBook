Brown 2020-12-22 Chapter 1 Purpose NOTE: This is a work in progress and has not yet been extensively peer-reviewed. These are the thoughts and professional opinions of one soil scientist following conversations among the Western Regional National Cooperative Soil Survey Standards Committee. The recommendations made here are my personal recommendations, not the consensus of the committee. Please contact andrew.g.brown@usda.gov with comments, questions or criticism. The Western Regional Taxonomy Committee recommendations are detailed in this document Pedologic knowledge has been hard won through the work of countless soil and earth scientists. This knowledge been distilled into standards and classification systems that allow us to consistently reason over diverse and complex natural systems. As new needs arise and knowledge is gained, criteria for classification and separation of concepts are refined and historic criteria are called in to question. Determining potential impacts of new or altered criteria throughout a classification system is complicated and time-consuming – perfect for the application of computer-aided reasoning. However, soils data and soil classification systems, particularly U.S. Soil Taxonomy, have nuances that require careful consideration. Changes to criteria that affect fundamental diagnostic features in Soil Taxonomy can have large influences on classification and, by association, grouping of soil concepts that are similar for use and management in soil surveys. We have developed data structures and computer code in the R package “aqp,” or Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology, that are capable of reasoning over soil profile data and criteria. This implementation of concepts has offered novel opportunities for data-driven analyses relating properties (predicted or observed) to taxonomic or interpretive groups. Routines for programmatic identification of soil features such as Argillic Horizons and Mollic Epipedons are fundamental steps towards automated classification using U.S. Soil Taxonomy. This book is a reproducible and open source implementation of the types of logic required to evaluate significant changes to the taxonomic system. Where proposals were specific enough to encode and begin to make comparisons, examples of those analyses are included. "],

This is a minimal example using the bookdown package (Xie 2020), which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). Each chapter corresponds to a proposal to the National Cooperative Soil Survey Standards Committee. Andrew has served on the Western Region National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) Regional Standards Committee in the past two cycles. The regional committees are tasked with evaluating proposals to identify impacts and provide feedback at the local to regional level. In reviewing these proposals, Andrew not only represents his local interests, but serves as a representative for the Southwest Soil Survey Region.

The latest version of the 13th Edition keys (2020/03/17) reflects some changes to ensure that this broader usage of the subgroup is clear. The use of coprogenous in the Histels is, in principle, allowed if a Limnic subgroup is defined – which appears to be the main impetus for this proposal. Mineralogy Classes Applied Only to Limnic Subgroups: Limnic materials (defined in chapter 3) with a thickness of 5 cm or more are mineralogy class criteria if the soil does not also have ferrihumic mineralogy. The following family classes are used: coprogenous, diatomaceous, and marly. Current wording in the key requires (criteria for) a Limnic subgroup (in the Histosols) in order to use a mineralogy class, so the criteria the authors have proposed (mirroring Histosols) make sense in that framework. However, it seems like the proposal was specifically focused on the coprogenous-Limnic variety of organic Gelisols. I am not sure we have enough other examples in Histels with limnic materials that are non-coprogenous to make a general change. While I have never worked in Alaska, I can imagine a variety of possible environments that could generate Limnic subgroups; some of which are not necessarily associated with the shoreline/avian coprogenous case detailed in the proposal. The marginal examples could have relatively little of this material (say, a few 1-2cm thick streaks) depending on the types of regular organic soil material and depositional environments they co-occur with. 5.2 On the relative difficulty of assessing cumulative &gt;5cm thickness of limnic materials in Gelisols versus Histosols: The cumulative &gt;5cm thickness requirement is probably more difficult to assess in Histels compared to Histosols. As written criterion modeled after Histosols requires exposure of the whole control section to know for sure that more or less than 5cm of limnic layers are present. Their proposed criteria parity with the Histosols makes sense – except for observation issues related to permafrost. This is, of course, the key difference between Histels and Histosols. I am not sure that identification of the materials in marginal Limnic cases is as straightforward as suggested in the proposal (in lieu of lab data or really good exposure of the soil) – so this could turn into a bit of a materials identification problem. 5.3 Suggestions There could be value in having some sort of a mineralogy class to capture that extreme “eutrophic” case that we discussed on the call. I am empathetic to the field concerns about not being able to map this accurately to the subgroup level using remote methods. I think that these properties might be better addressed at the family level (in something like mineralogy class) rather than in more subgroup level taxa that could wind up being difficult or impractical to identify. That way individuals who are interested / need to look at these soils in full detail have a framework to capture it but it doesn’t impose challenging-to-assess limitations on higher order classification of Gelisols.

I see no inherent issue with these taxa and defer to folks more familiar with mapping needs in AK to determine whether adding these taxa would “help” – especially considering that Gelolls currently have very low mapped acreage and require things e.g. dolomitic parent material for their pattern of occurrence. I could imagine the base status and other properties to be ecologically significant – which would, in my mind, justify the use of the new taxa – even if rare. I support this proposal if the committee agrees. 6.2 Skeletal, cryic inclusions in a “gelic landscape?” I wonder whether with the amount of sand/fragments/high thermal conductivity materials some of these are cryic inclusions in a “gelic landscape.” It seems the authors have thought about that. I trust the professors who are on the paper and proposal to have given this idea at least a fair shake. They did exclude some sites from “gelic” in their paper. Not sure how feasible it would be to instrument these soils to “prove” they are gelic – I can imagine it being a nightmare. "],

I think the significant impacts of tephra on use and management of some Aridisols is made clear from the proposal. That said, the proposed criteria are quite broad and are likely to lead to identification of Tephric epipedons in many places outside those discussed. There is a need for a working group to address the impacts outside of proposer’s region. I think that the current exclusion of other epipedons creates more taxonomic problems than it solves. It may be that was done to ensure historic taxonomies would key out to the new Tephrids? If the goal is to just “slip this in” to allow for new suborder/subgroup distinctions within the Aridisols, overriding historic epipedon assignments by mutual exclusion probably needs to be avoided since epipedons are criteria for several soil orders. Developing clear soil property criteria for “Tephric materials” will be necessary. I am not disputing that tephra-based soil materials have unique characteristics that warrant their separation, especially in the Aridic SMR. I just think the proposed criteria need to be defined more explicitly. Therefore, I am suggesting this proposal needs revision. 7.2 What would be recorded on the 232 or in NASIS to back up a Tephric epipedon assignment? Parent material = tephra would be a site level attribute… and assuming Site Parent Material depths were populated one could determine intersection with horizons – but what about horizon level attributes? % volume of cinders or bombs is a horizon level attribute that would be recorded as fragments Fragment volume does not apply to all Tephric epipedons; the &gt;50% by volume threshold might be more readily determined for cinders and bombs than fine/coarse ash Would a thickness requirement be better for finer materials? Similar to Andisols order criteria for ASP thickness? How commonly are potential Tephrics devoid of coarser fragments / comprised of only fine/coarse ash? Could ASHY texture modifier be used to identify the finer materials in horizon data where fragments are absent (or have volumes &lt;50%)? For comparison: for the Mollic epipedon one records structure, color and carbon to “prove” it is “mollic.” We often use color in lieu of carbon data for field use. I am struggling to find similar types of categorical/quantitative criteria for the Tephric epipedon that uniquely distinguish it from e.g. Mollic and Melanic. While I think I understand the intent of Criterion #1 I don’t think it unambiguously defines “Tephric materials” – this leads me to my second main point. 7.3 On use of “rock structure” or “parent structure” in criteria The epipedon (Gr. epi, over, upon, and pedon, soil) is a horizon that forms at or near the surface and in which most of the rock structure has been destroyed. (KST p. 7) Rock structure includes fine stratification (5 mm or less thick) in unconsolidated sediments (eolian, alluvial, lacustrine, or marine) and saprolite derived from consolidated rocks in which the unweathered minerals and pseudomorphs of weathered minerals retain their relative positions to each other. (KST, p. 335) The melanic epipedon … is unique among epipedons. It commonly forms in deposits of tephra and can receive fresh deposits of volcanic ash. Therefore, this horizon is permitted to have layers within and above the epipedon that are not part of the melanic epipedon (KST p. 7) Recent alluvial or eolian deposits that retain most of the original rock structure are not considered to have A horizons unless they are cultivated (KST p. 335) By definition, epipedons can’t have rock structure in “most” of their volume. So, either we are defining a novel soil material derived from tephra (that is not the material we recognize in Melanic/Andic/Vitrandic) or we are redefining what Epipedons are. I think the intent of the proposal was to do the former – and I am supportive of that goal. Are subhorizons of Tephric epipedons commonly designated as A horizons or C horizons? It seems like they should be “A” most of the time to be an “Epipedon.” But fresh material that has “rock structure” would probably be designated C. My suggestion would be to drop any discussion of rock/parent structure – as that is contraindicated with the epipedon definition. I do not think you have a strong case for an epipedon based on the fact that these things have rock structure – if the geological layering is the major factor, perhaps it should actually be designated C, with some sort of A or V horizon mantled within it. Require a minimum volume/thickness of Tephric materials - which would of course need to be defined explicitly like all other soil materials (such as Albic Materials, Gelic Materials, etc.). Or perhaps what you are describing is a specific name for the layers “fresh” materials that are specifically excluded under the Melanic definition, allowing it to be discontinuous. I imagine this definition could include their glassy/short-range order mineralogy reflective of rapid cooling with low degree of weathering, other physical attributes (gas vesicles, roots in grain pores), mode of deposition etc. It may not have elevated optical density, or other indices of ASP, indicating the relative “freshness.” It seems important that places that get correlated need to exhaust all the possibilities of these being Andisols. 7.4 On distinction of Tephric materials from Vitrandic/Andic soil properties Chris F. had an excellent suggestion to investigate the WRB definition of Tephric – I think WRB provides a definition that could be emulated. Note that this uses the volume of glassy minerals, but excludes Andic and Vitric materials; this contrasts with the Tephric epipedon proposal in the US reviewed here. As defined, Tephric epipedon could or would include soil materials with ASP. https://lorexplor.istex.fr/urban_soils.en/index.php/Tephric_material_%28WRB%29#Description If proposal were revised to exclude ASP/Vitrandic materials, the criteria for separating them would probably require justification based on Andic Soil Properties limits / lab data. It seems like Tephric -&gt; Vitrandic -&gt; Andic -&gt; ASP represents a pedogenic gradient in terms of time and/or climate (for given PM) and would intermingle commonly. To my limited understanding, the Tephric is important where the physical occlusion of the subsurface is major player, whereas in ASP the relative higher degree of chemical weathering gives unique physical and chemical properties. 7.5 Additional comment/questions/thoughts: Can a Tephric epipedon occur underneath organic soil materials / Folistic or Histic epipedons? I can think of this being relevant for some of our forested areas in northeast CA with recent (Andisol and non-Andisol) pumice deposits Does the entire thickness of the epipedon need to be continuous from the upper bound (as implied in definition) Or could the thickness requirement be met from multiple strata (individually &lt;5cm) i.e. like Andisol criteria (36 cumulative cm within upper 60cm)/Melanic? I am curious about the justification for 5cm minimum thickness – this is the minimum regardless of grain size distribution. Proposal suggests that any tephra on the surface has marked effects. My feeling is that 5cm is thin for a diagnostic surface feature. Would 5cm of coarse ash behave the same as 10cm of cinders? Maybe not the same, but I suppose the argument is that both of those would be more like each other than a soil with 0cm tephra? "],

Hazic materials concept in the Factarts 8.8 Portifactarts and Portortharts –", " Chapter 8 Artifact Soils / Artesols Order (2/6/20; PDF; 525 KB) 8.1 Recommendation Recommendation: Return to authors (2020/03/17) I think that it is exciting to be reviewing this proposal and I look forward to the eventual incorporation of these ideas into the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Humans shape soils like no other force. Much of my commentary pertains to Hazic materials concept. I have no objections to the artifactic epipedon as described – it has several avenues into it, but the variety of HAHT soils necessitates this. I reviewed the sub-proposals as needed to understand the proposed Keys but did not evaluate extensively. On the surface, most of the proposed changes looked well thought out, but evaluating their impact requires progress on the higher level components of the proposal. 8.2 On use of surrogate spatial data The author of the proposal included several suggestions on using novel data sources/analyses/models to support classification decisions. This is an interesting avenue to discuss – as in practice we have to make inferences about criteria we don’t have data for – and new demands on soil survey have necessitated new data (particularly spatial data and “continuous” rasters). While references were provided and brief explanations were given, I would rather see some demonstrations of the procedures with real data for this proposal. 8.3 On example data (not) provided by the authors On that same note, despite some mention of existing series concepts that would fit the new taxa, no pedon or component data or even acreage impact estimates were shown in the proposal – which was a major, but not uncommon, shortcoming. Time and time again, you will see my thing is soil materials based criteria. I think the criteria related to Hazic material definition should be evaluated. I am not convinced that the diverse criteria proposed will support an unambiguous definition of the materials involved. 8.4 Comments on Hazic materials / spatial overlay of site properties for the purposes of soil classification I think overlay of spatial maps of external, non-specific soil or site conditions should rarely, if ever, be used in classifying a particular pedon/component – at least in terms of the way the criteria are written in the keys. By “external” I mean EPA contaminated lands maps, vector extents of superfund sites, surficial geology maps or any other “categorical” determination that could be portrayed with one or more polygons – but might not reflect the granularity of a point soil observation. Such sources certainly provide supporting documentation about extent of a soil concept – but ultimately the classification of the concept should be based on decisions about the dominant conditions of soil properties – in the relevant control sections – for that component. The use of spatial layers / construction data / EPA determinations / chemical analysis etc. could facilitate the definition of lined/capped landfill, unlined landfill, non-landfill, contaminated areas – which surely would be a major factor in mapunit design/delineation. But there is a scale mismatch between these external layers and an individual soil component. While I am against encoding the use of external layers/determinations directly in the Keys criteria, we regularly do this type of “spatial overlay logic” for mapping of concepts like moisture and temperature regime. The fact that inconsistent external sources are not specifically encoded in the Keys is a benefit, not a drawback. 8.5 On the Soil Moisture/Temperature regime analogy No doubt there are aspects to be desired RE: SMR and STR – but to their credit … they are connected to soil properties SMR: the moisture status over a particular depth and time interval STR: the annual average thermal condition of the soil at a particular depth We have soil properties in the Keys definition – even though we might use something like PRISM mean annual air temperature or nearest weather stations to infer the spatial distributions based on a modeled relationship. To the authors credit, they encourage developing thresholds and geospatial models from data – even if the model is “bad” at least the process would be documented/reproducible and could be repeated if new data were obtained. 8.6 Comments on Analytical Demands of Hazic Materials From my perspective, we rarely, if ever, have the data required for adequate geostatistical treatment of contamination data. Even if we do know what the threshold for “elevated concentration” is – there is a lot of potential error to come from a poorly developed kriging/hyperspectral map “hardened” to a spatial location using a crisp probability of 0.5. I worry about explicitly encoding too many “open to interpretation”/unstable short circuits/criteria (separated by OR) into Hazic material definition. Can we rely on soil survey standards and protocol to deal with estimating spatial distribution for contamination risk assessment under these open-ended conditions? The author’s effort to include a variety of lines of evidence for supporting Hazic materials is well intentioned and reflective of the variety of data sources that soil scientists need to synthesize to make our products. I am cautiously supportive of the proposed &gt;50% probability of exceeding some concentration threshold – it makes sense – but defining the thresholds and data quality will be key. 8.7 Comments on Garbage v.s. Hazic materials concept in the Factarts It seems that “garbage” is explicitly included in the Hazic materials definition – but Hazic materials are only used as a criterion for the Wastifactarts. Factarts key ordering would suggest that Garbi- and Manu- great groups could contain garbage that classifies as Hazic materials. But, as defined, the first two taxa do not require Hazic materials. This seems intentional but might require more justification since the potential mixing of non-Hazic and Hazic soils within higher order taxa seems like something to be avoided. If all garbage containing soils are/should be Hazic – make sure the Hazic definition reflects that. Based on my understanding, garbage usually is, but is not guaranteed to be, Hazic. In lieu of lab data, the 35% volume threshold would become quite important for Hazic/non-Hazic as defined. Garbifactarts versus Manufactarts These great groups are distinguished based on: “garbage, waste, trash, or refuse” content (~approximately Hazic materials) whether they are “lined” or “unlined” (within 200cm; landfill deposits) Suggestions: Garbage-containing soils should be Manufactarts if they have a manufactured layer within 200cm, Wastifactarts if the garbage is Hazic, and Other Factarts if non-Hazic. Garbifactarts go away – as well as all discussion of “garbage” and “landfills” in Keys. Lean on definition of Hazic materials and the Wastifactarts to capture: the soil properties of “landfills”, “garbage” and other potentially noxious waste materials. I like the Capic subgroup in Garbifactarts – why was this not used elsewhere? There are currently no other constraints / subdivisions of these taxa on where the artifactic horizon occurs in the profile – but I can see it affecting interpretations / exposure to toxicity. Manufactarts would key out first among Factarts for manufactured layer within 200cm (root /water restrictive within current purview of Soil Survey) and artifactic horizon. I see no need to limit this Great Group to “collection areas” (subjective); presence of the manufactured layer and artifactic horizon is enough Hazic Manufactarts capture the hazardous (Hazic) soil materials with a manufactured layer I am presuming the artifactic must occur above the manufactured layer – the text of the proposal somewhat suggests this but the key itself is not explicit Consider “Leptic” subgroup for ~&lt;100cm to RLL? Or is shallow family / 50cm enough? The Epiaquarts use “Antirhyzic” for &lt;100 which has an interesting ring to it, but I am not a fan of new terms when we have existing concepts that capture this more generally Wastifactarts capture the hazardous (Hazic) soil materials without a manufactured layer Other Factarts: If the “garbage” is innocuous the soils can key out in Psammi/Humi/Porti (Haplo) 8.8 Portifactarts and Portortharts – Other soils – why not Haplofactarts and Haplortharts? Simpler and keeps parity with other taxa. The Port- formative element makes sense but I’m not keen on it for these cases where the taxon is the last Great Group in a Suborder key. Again, stick to tradition rather than introducing new terms that are used similarly to other concepts in the Keys. "],

That said, simultaneous changes to thickness and materials criteria may dramatically shift concepts – and those potential shifts have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Too many moving parts in a single proposal hampers both proposer and reviewer ability to evaluate impacts. Therefore, I recommended this proposal be returned to the authors in the 2020 review. Criteria changes for “mollic materials” – such as addition of pH measurements as surrogates for ammonium acetate base saturation, or changes to not-commonly-used color criteria, will need considerably more justification. Also, the authors do not address what, if any, changes would be made to harmonize the proposed Mollic definition with the existing definition of the Umbric. Revisions to this proposal should address intended changes to the Umbric. Is the intent to leave the Umbric unchanged? If so, that should be stated. This reviewer thinks that changes to requirements in Mollic, notably thickness, should be mirrored in the Umbric. I understand that it may be simpler to tackle just one for starters, but the long-term intent should be clear. Review of specific changes proposed, by “Rule Number” in the proposed Mollic epipedon criteria. 9.2 Opening Paragraph I fully support removing 18cm-mixing in favor of a more uniform depth criterion that does not involve mixing of any kind. 9.3 Rule 1 I work in an area of the world (California, Xeric SMR, Thermic STR) where Hard-setting Mollisols and would-be Mollisols exist. I generally do support the proposed logic here. While I agree with the intent, I think the potential correlation workload / impact on existing series is more significant than the proposal lets on. These hard-when-dry soils should be Mollisols if they meet all other criteria – the “growing season” for our annual grasses is before they set hard, and if they are irrigated the point is moot – it generally behaves like a mollic if it has the carbon. I spoke briefly with Phil Smith (Soil Survey Leader in the MLRA 17 Soil Survey Office – CA Central Valley). Phil is far more knowledgeable than I on the Central Valley soils (MLRA 17) as well as those in MLRAs 14 and 15. He says that massive and hard when dry is a common occurrence in soils he encounters, and he would rather see them classify as Mollisols if other criteria are met. Simple Example: Yolo series, MLRA 17 Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Mollic Xerofluvents Range in Characteristics state “The surface is massive or platy and is hard or very hard.” Type location has 66cm of A horizon. Range in characteristics and typical pedon for A horizon state that mollic colors and carbon (OM 1.5-3%) are met. The typical pedon description reports a combined minimum thickness of ~17 inches or ~43cm for the A horizons – which is solidly greater than 25cm. Type location could go Pachic Haploxerolls with no fine stratification in epipedon and assuming carbon is met. Presumably Xerofluvents have quite a bit of variation in them but a lot of that variation is in substratum – basing off of type location and RIC – and the soils I have seen – Yolo would become a Mollisol, and probably would be Pachic. Perhaps individual components/phases would be correlated differently/as taxadjuncts/to a new series. These are all decisions needing to be made at the Soil Survey Regional or MLRA office level. A very brief investigation of non-Mollisols– including various Subgroups and Great Groups in Thermic STR and Xeric SMR – turned up several series that could be impacted by the proposed changes to massive and hard criteria. I include a short list below – to be clear, I am not saying all of these would change – many are marginal on carbon content even with changes to structure and consistence. But they also often have limited data to support either Mollisol or non-Mollisol classification. Example Series: Tierra, Positas, Reiff, Jacinto, Honn, Keefers, Yokohl, Jahant, Sycamore, Zamora, Brentwood, Stomar, Camarillo, Hueneme, Pleasanton, Bellyspring To my knowledge, the slickest way to approach these questions is something like the PostgreSQL OSD full-text search created by Dylan Beaudette: http://soilmap2-1.lawr.ucdavis.edu/osd-search/, with those results then coupled with the fetchOSD function accessible through the soilDB R package – which provides facilities for accessing parsed OSD data for analysis The traditional way of doing this querying the SC database for specific taxa, and then text-mining the various sections of OSDs manually (or using soilDB). It is not clear that the authors did this – I would want to know what groups of soils they queried, and more specific examples of things they found. 9.4 Rule 2 Rock structure includes fine stratification. Epipedons, by definition (KST p 7, ST p 21), do not have rock structure. Therefore, the absence of rock structure is fundamental to what an epipedon is. Criteria 1c in proposed definition is unnecessary since “[in an epipedon] most of the rock structure [including fine stratification] has been destroyed.” If there are issues with current definition of rock structure, or its role in defining the epipedon, propose a change rather than working around the definition. Suggestion: specifically encoding the rock structure &lt;50% volume (as opposed to “most”) value in epipedon definition would be a good change. 9.5 Rule 3 These are rarely used criteria – and they add complexity – but I think there needs to be more thorough investigation of where they may be used. Please explain the method the authors used to determine that the criteria “could not be verified if used in any existing soil series”. What analysis was done to verify these criteria were not used? What were the results? Is there any way to simplify the wording, while retaining the same meaning? I am cautious about simultaneously changing thickness and materials criteria in same proposal. 9.6 Rule 4 I do not support the use of pH as a surrogate for base saturation as formal criteria. Dissimilar criteria, separated with an OR, results in perhaps unintentional equal weighting in determination of membership to a taxonomic class. The authors did this analysis for all the KSSL data – so they should have included a graph (like Appendix 2) of this data along with proposed thresholds. Most reviewers would not necessarily be able to thoroughly evaluate this proposal without at least some graphical representation The proposed pH thresholds are conservative in that they correspond with median pH by either method at ~80% ammonium acetate base saturation at pH 7 (Appendix 2. California KSSL data, upper 25cm mineral soil material [meeting organic carbon requirement]; n=916 pedons, 2043 horizons). I think these surrogate criteria could result in more confusion – even though they are well protected against “false positives” for mollic as the data show. As proposed, 1:1 soil water and CaCl2 would be on equal footing, but use of both methods in parallel has not been adequately justified in proposal. The proposed pH criteria cannot invert to identify Umbric; you would need conservatively acidic thresholds in the Umbric criteria which would leave a pH-indeterminant area in the intermediate range say, pH ~5.5-6.5. We know this to be the case – that the relationship is not as viable in that range. Protecting against false positive for Mollic epipedons leads to identification of more Umbric epipedons when color, organic carbon, thickness are met and base saturation data are not available, these are supposed to be mutually exclusive. Use of surrogate data is a separate, important issue that needs to be dealt with all the time in routine soil survey – and I think there is room to develop standards and guidelines for how that is done when the goal is supporting classification. However, this reviewer believes that these models and relationships should be developed on a local basis and not formally encoded in Soil Taxonomy unless they are “universal” The net effect of surrogates is short circuiting the intended logic of the Keys in lieu of data – which ultimately detracts from later efforts to improve the Keys. This especially is an issue where the surrogates could lead to inconsistent results with historic meanings, or depending on the lab/field method used, or in presence of optional/missing data with an OR operator in the key logic. The case of having all three possible measurements and them not “agreeing” with one another is another possible wrinkle. I presume base saturation would take precedence if you had it. I think the secondary carbonates criterion is OK, but worry about the possible effects of recent liming + lack of equilibrium on effervescence? 9.7 Rule 5 My preference for this simplification proposal would be towards simpler statements that reflect essentially the same meaning – rather than just abandoning criteria. 9.8 Rule 6 I support the intent of the proposed minimum thickness changes – I think the criteria are too complicated as is. I don’t like minimum thickness depending on variably on subsurface diagnostic features or on their bottom depths (e.g. Argillic bottom depth) – this winds up being problematic for a variety of reasons related to data quality at depth. That said, it is likely that the increase of thickness requirement will split some existing series definitions – not necessarily in a “meaningful” way in terms of mapping. Many Xerolls have low-end ranges in thickness of their mollic materials around 18-20cm. Two to three inches (difference from 25cm) is more than just a round off difference that can be swept under the rug. The low end RIC are in part driven by existing taxonomic limits/concepts, unit conversion, assumed plow layer thickness etc. but is also reflected in the pedon data. For each series/components spanning the new thickness threshold a decision would need to be made about taxon placement – theoretically with some of the supporting pedons being re-correlated if needed. Marginal Mollisols (that don’t range much/at all beyond 25cm thick epipedon) would become Alfisols, Inceptisols, Entisols, etc. based on dominant condition type logic – this might be quite common in my area of the world with the few true Mollisols on the high end of RIC being non-limiting, similar soil inclusions when you consider their areal extent Conversely, soils that tend to have thicker-than-25 mollic materials would be Mollisols, possibly with a couple inches on lower-end series RIC truncated. 9.9 Rule 7 I support the idea of allowing Mollic epipedons in Aridic SMR if that is how this criterion has been historically interpreted. This may mean that you can irrigate your way into the Mollisols, by providing moisture for net primary productivity where the growing season normally would not have had adequate moisture. Considering that the criteria for moisture content of soil materials operates on the subhorizons of the epipedon, rather than the soil moisture control section (which may differ somewhat from the epipedon boundaries) it is rare that this criterion would be applied in the presence of adequate site specific data. The criterion may have historic value, but it probably is and has been routinely bypassed. I am not aware of any viable way to systematically evaluate where/whether this criterion has been used as the data elements involved are not / have not historically been reported at a level of disaggregation necessary to make this specific taxonomic evaluation. 9.10 Rule 8 I am not sure what the intent of the wording/justification for criterion 1e is. Were authors intending to propose an alternate definition of “fluidity”? We have Fluidity Class (in Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils, pages 2-65 and 2-105). I can’t really comment from experience on the relative utility of n value versus Fluidity Class – I have never “measured” the n value. Just used the common guidelines. Suggestion: replace criterion with Fluidity Class is non-fluid to achieve the desired effect using existing standards 9.11 Other notes “component horizon or layer” = “subhorizon” (semantics) Footnote 1: this footnote needs to be clarified So, properties of upper 18cm are still relevant for water/wind/HTM? Or should this mixed thickness be 25cm to match the minimum thickness? Also, “weighted average sample” – depth weighted average? Volume weighted average (I.e accounting for bulk density)? “as if” it were physically mixed? Is this mathematical or physical mixing? – and what are the weights? I support the mathematical mixing – but it has its problems when the overlying or underlying material would not meet mollic on its own. Personally, I question the value of mixing of non-mollic and mollic materials to result in a positive mollic determination. Do we really need to include these cases in mollic epipedon? It is important for historic purposes to ensure same classification of agricultural and non-agricultural usage of same “soil type,” but in my mind it seems it has potential to dilute the Mollic concept and/or be abused to make more Mollisols in floodplains. At a minimum, the reasoning behind this footnote should be expanded on in the revised proposal. I think we could exclude recent deposits up to a certain (thin) thickness from evaluation for epipedon criteria. Beyond that point we need to ask ourselves if we have something that is more like a Mollic *fluvents/Fluvaquents in that geomorphic position. Technically, stratification or rock structure of the recently deposited material precludes an epipedon, and where a surface is buried you have criteria for Fluventic/Cumulic irregular carbon distribution with increasing depth. Just because you mix away the evidence of this doesn’t change the geologic evidence of how that material got there; in an undisturbed case it would be described differently than after tillage. Footnote 2: The only method for determination of base saturation for Mollic epipedon is the base saturation based on CEC and extractable cations in ammonium acetate at pH 7. What “laboratory analysis by proximal sensors in the field” is approved for this purpose? Footnote 3: I recognize the potential value of harmonizing the strange handling of possible (lack of) Mollic epipedons in Albolls – but it does not have a place in this “simplifying” proposal. The proposed change mirrors the criteria for Albolls, which are allowed to have horizons that would be a Mollic epipedon if it were not for an Albic Horizon within 18 cm. Albic could be as thin as 1cm, per definition. Seems like the thickness requirement is only relevant to Albolls suborder, so we don’t need it in the Mollic Epipedon definition. "],

The authors suggest that this will help account for eliminating the 10cm over root-limiting layer, and 18 - 25cm sliding scale thickness. However, only a small fraction of Mollisols who previously met thickness criteria, but utilized the sliding scale thickness requirement, would be retained in a single taxonomic group under proposed new criteria – even with this new epipedon. Redefining something at a high level that traditionally is more along the lines of series criteria is a bit of a problem for re-correlation. The Tenumollic epipedon does little to buffer the effects of the proposed changes in the parallel proposal to “Simplify the Mollic epipedon”. In some cases, the combination of the two splits existing series concepts at the suborder or even order level. The combination of changes in thickness and material requirements, as well non-specific changes being made to the Mollisols key (is this at the Great Group or the Suborder level?) results in mostly hard-to-resolve correlation problems. It is not clear that the new taxa based on this epipedon would offer any significant interpretive benefit over the Lithic subgroups or shallow families that already are correlated within the Mollisols. To push this a bit further: it’s not clear (from points made in the proposal) why these very shallow soils should be Mollisols at all. If you are establishing a new suborder, the burden is on you to justify this. This strikes me as somewhat odd, as a lot of the Mollic simplifications argued for removing criteria with historical precedent – this particular one seems like the easiest to do away with, conceptually. 10.2 Suggestions I would encourage the authors to push for better distinction of shallow versus very shallow soils at the series/component level; historically, perhaps due to shortcomings in the taxonomy, or natural facets of landscape variability, that distinction has not been clear enough for the Tenumollic to drop in cleanly with existing mapping. If the change in taxonomy amounts to simply a high-level re-spelling of a portion of existing lower-level taxonomic concepts – without added benefit in terms of being able to separate dissimilar soils – or worse, obscuring a historic meaning or implied range in characteristics – it, in my opinion, does not likely serve much use to the process of making and interpreting soil surveys. I am suggesting that this proposal be rejected. The thickness criteria for mollic epipedons could be substantially simplified without altering the underlying meaning or adding new high-level distinctions in the Mollisols key. Simplifications to the thickness requirements of the Mollic epipedon should not require the creation of a new epipedon. 10.3 An investigation into OSD Typical pedons What follows is an investigation of some series concepts in MLRAs 18 and 22A where the OSD Typical Pedon had a bedrock contact within 25cm and taxonomy Haploxerolls or Haplocryolls. Taxonomic changes equate to correlation decisions that would need to be resolved if the proposed changes were implemented. The discussion demonstrates the types of changes that might occur for a limited extent (two MLRAs) – but the process could be expanded nationwide given time and resources TODO: EXPAND "],

None of the proposed changes are necessary – and there is no single clear proposal to even review here. There is room for clarifying existing definition of root-limiting layer versus the general concept of “root-restrictive” – since clearly there is much confusion – but the proposals do not offer any clarity. More concerning, their solutions seem likely to add to existing confusion, rather than reduce it. 11.2 Selected quotes “There is a question where the regolith is thick and the soil scientist stops at two meters and the geologist starts at 50 meters - who’s field is this one in between?” – Guy Smith, 1.1 Definition of Soil, Guy Smith Interviews, p. 2 “We use diagnostic horizons in Soil Taxonomy rather than the traditional letter designations because the letter designations of A, B, and C to which we add suffixes like t, or e, or what have you, make it impossible to avoid the use of A, B. and C considerations in the taxonomy.” – Guy Smith, 1.6 Basic Principles of Soil Taxonomy, Guy Smith Interviews, p. 21 “The use of a suffix symbol is not restricted only to those horizons and other criteria as defined in Soil Taxonomy.” – Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition, p. 337 11.3 Concepts in Soil Taxonomy NOTE: I use the “cementation” term, but am aware that the replacement for this term (“coherence”) has been accepted as a change to our national standard. This document uses cementation, which refers to a standard set of classes and method familiar to most field soil scientists. Cementation is the term still used in most standards in wide circulation. Horizons and layers that are root-restrictive commonly coincide with diagnostic features that imply a root-limiting layer (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition, p. 319). Currently root-restriction as a general concept is not defined in one place in NCSS standards. Rather it is portrayed in a relative sense (within a pedon/polypedon) using a combination of horizon designations and/or diagnostic materials which imply varying degrees of restriction to root entry into the matrix. A Cr or Cd horizon is intended to be a root-limiting layer if the upper boundary of that horizon coincides with a paralithic or densic contact. All paralithic or densic contacts coincide with the top depth of a Cr or Cd horizon. However, the inverse is often, but not always, true. This is because the uppermost boundary of paralithic or densic materials may not be a contact. If there is no a contact, there is no root-limiting layer. A horizon with a d suffix implies physical root-restriction, without any implications about parent material kind, crack spacing or a root-limiting layer. Use of d suffix is not “wrong” if it is used to depict relative “physical root-restriction” coupled with “non-cemented” cementation class. If the criteria for densic contact/materials are adhered to in determining depth to a root-limiting layer, decision to use or not use d in a field description will not affect taxonomy or interpretations. A horizon with r suffix implies soft or weathered bedrock, with a specific cementation class. But is not limited to specific bedrock kinds or crack spacings. Densic materials, paralithic materials, and the materials below a lithic contact have in their definition root-restriction to “only cracks.” The Materials are separated based on their cementation class. Using cementation, there is no conceptual overlap between the corresponding diagnostic features for the purposes of Soil Taxonomy. In these materials, there is also no specific implication of a root-limiting layer, but root-restriction is implied because roots exist only in cracks. The cementation class of a layer is determined by a defined method. Air-dry fragments of the right size are placed in water for 1 hour. If they do not slake, they are cemented, and their resistance to rupture following an applied force is measured. In practice, in areas with less-well-cemented to noncemented bedrock/sediment, these observations can be made routinely from air-dry correlation box samples and are used to develop working models for dominant conditions of various soil forming factors within a survey extent. While determination of exact cementation class for layers and profiles may vary somewhat, general patterns do exist that are enough to distinguish between non-cemented, and less versus more than moderately cemented – sufficient for assigning the relevant restrictions for calculation of e.g. T factor. 11.4 Proposed criteria not related to soil properties Some proposed criteria are objectionable due to relying on inferences not related to soil properties. This comment is specifically addressing the strong points made about limiting Cd to “Quaternary” deposits or certain classes of parent materials – such as the ones given in examples in the Keys for densic/paralithic materials or the different horizon designations. Based on this line of reasoning, I think the example parent materials that are currently included after the definitions of in the Keys should be removed. They have potential to be misconstrued as the definition, rather than examples. It seems that these proposal authors made that error. Parent materials, specific origins, etc. get connected to genetic horizon designations in people’s minds – but no universal connection between diagnostic features and parent material kind exists. Some genetic horizons and suffixes are associated with general groups of parent materials – organic materials, limnic materials, water, bedrock etc. – but these are broad categories that have dramatically different properties that are for the most part easily discernible. They do not invoke specific interpretations about age/origin that cannot be determined from within a pit by a trained soil scientist. Time since deposition or emplacement does not necessarily coincide with how weathered an exposure is, how that exposure weathers, or if it remains consolidated. In certain systems rocks/sediments have been deposited, buried, consolidated, re-exposed, eroded, re-buried etc. From the soil’s perspective, how “old” is the outer surface of the rock that we expose at the bottom of our soil profile? Soil horizon designation should not be reduced to an overlay of location on a geologic map and cross referencing to a table of theoretical ages or classes – essentially a categorical (nonsoil) map of the world where various soil designations are “allowed” and where they are not. 11.4.1 “relatively unaltered” While I don’t find I have a use for Cd on bedrock in my area – and have even “argued against” use of Cd in favor of more-cemented Cr – I am very cautious of adding new limitations on the usage of d where they are not needed. Bedrock, densic is an option as a restriction in NASIS for where non-cemented densic materials are present in bedrock-derived layers that impose a Densic Contact. Based on my experience on highly weathered bedrock of the Sierra Nevada Foothills, non-cemented weathered bedrock usually does not meet the criteria in densic materials for “relatively unaltered [by pedogenesis]” if one looks carefully. In some Paralithic Materials we probably stretch the definition of “relatively unaltered” for practical purposes. This is likely not the case in many systems, but if you have significant pedogenesis in the matrix, d is allowed as a designation, but none of the densic or paralithic diagnostic features (which require “relatively unaltered materials”) are technically available. In such cases, use or non-use of d or r would be a moot point taxonomically speaking – denoting only root-restriction or cementation of the materials, respectively – which are not diagnostic of anything in and of themselves – and have no direct effect on the root-limiting layer. 11.5 NASIS/SSURGO perspective In NASIS/SSURGO, the effect of high density that is not associated with a Densic Contact/Materials can be captured by populating higher values for those d (or non-d) layers at the Pedon/Component Horizon level and/or assigning different representative structure (e.g. platy, massive) as appropriate. We don’t typically consider the rock or pararock fragments in the soil profile to be “root-restrictive,” per se, though they certainly impose structure on the arrangement of soil materials. Unfortunately, in NASIS/SSURGO we have limited options to depict presence of weathered rock structure that no longer is cemented, but also may influence root distribution. So, one or more new “rock structure” type choices in Component/Pedon Horizon Structure to complement use of “massive” or “single grained” would help ease the pain of calling non-cemented, weathered bedrock C, where conceptually it might seem to fit better with Cr because of its origin and relationship to underlying layers – or even with Cd because of describer’s interpretation of relative physical root-restriction imposed by rock fabric. There were no such suggestions of novel material properties or determinations to help “resolve” this apparent issue in either proposal. 11.6 A counter-proposal based on existing standards Basic guide to identification of root-limiting layers in terms of master horizons, horizon suffixes, and Diagnostic Materials/features 11.6.1 Root-Limiting Layer A root-limiting layer defines the bottom of the soil horizons considered for most, but not all, differentiae at the family level (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition, p. 319). The upper boundary of a root-limiting layer coincides with the upper boundary of the following diagnostic features: Duripan and Fragipan Petrocalcic, Petrogypsic, and Placic Horizons Continuous Ortstein Densic, Lithic, Paralithic, Petroferric, or Manufactured Layer Contacts All diagnostic horizons and features listed above have their own specific language of what constitutes root “limitation.” All (except for fragipan) pertain to a spacing of cracks/fractures where roots can enter of 10 cm or greater. Some have additional criteria for cementation and/or statements about lateral continuity. 11.6.2 Horizon designations (field interpretation): R - strongly cemented to indurated bedrock; “generally” cracks roots enter are widely spaced Cr - extremely weakly to moderately cemented bedrock; crack spacing may be much &lt;10cm *d - physically root-restrictive *m - &gt;90% pedogenic cementation (&gt;extremely weakly), physically root-restrictive 11.6.3 Tabular Guide Table 11.1: Guideline to root-limiting layers, evidence of root-limitation, cementation and root-restriction for various genetic horizons, diagnostic horizons, features and materials.

Cd always denotes physical root-restriction, is not used on cemented materials, and is not necessarily a root-limiting layer unless cracks where roots can enter are &gt;10cm apart. *m is physically root-restrictive due to a pedogenic process but does not explicitly imply a root-limiting layer. It is more specific about volume of cementation than r. There are instances where an m could be used that would not be a root-limiting layer per Soil Taxonomy e.g. horizon cemented &gt;90% with salts more soluble than gypsum e.g. “zm” Paralithic/densic materials imply root-restriction and “relatively unaltered [by pedogenesis]”. Either could occur above a paralithic or densic contact. 11.7 On an explicit definition for “root-restriction” We could explicitly define “root-restriction” (by some measure, say bulk density) as a lesser limitation relative to the root-limiting layer – and then require that for the use of d. But, I think greater flexibility is offered to the field soil scientist with the existing definition of d implying simply “non-cemented, physically root restrictive” with no parent material connotations or specific quantification of how restrictive – which is pretty subjective and dependent on relative local conditions. 11.8 How to handle weathered bedrock that is root-restrictive but non-cemented: If bedrock is non-cemented, it does not meet the cementation criteria for paralithic materials or the Cr designation. If it does not exhibit pedogenic alteration, you should designate it C or Cd because it is non-cemented parent material – your choice as describer depends on your interpretation of relative root-restriction within the profile and within the landscape. 11.9 Identifying the root-limiting layer in weathered bedrock If roots appear to have a regular, closely spaced, distribution into a fresh exposure of the upper boundary of weathered bedrock material, then there is no evidence for a root-limiting layer. If roots are absent, the assessment needs to be based on “distance between cracks where roots can enter,” and it is up to the describer to infer where/if a root-limiting layer occurs. Some layers could have &gt;90% bedrock fragments and in lieu texture of “parachanners” “paragravel” or similar – but cracks and included soil materials commonly have or could have roots. Technically, the horizon designation should be based on the soil material “in the fractures” – so your ability to manage getting a sample to texture and inspect in the field will probably guide you to an appropriate designation – don’t overthink it. This is often where one should find Cd is an inappropriate choice of designation. How much soil material, if any, you manage to get from the fractures is dependent on local nature of bedrock: composition, fracture pattern etc. Observations made with an auger or other drilling device are going to disrupt fabric of the soil and rock, and will interfere with assessments of depth, cementation and arrangement of cracks – and also offer limited evidence if any of rooting patterns – so the describer needs to be calibrated to the nature of local materials exposed in real pits if they intend to interpret auger borings for distinguishing certain contacts. You could be well below the upper boundary of in situ weathered bedrock before you find cementation in a pit – whereas augers can be quite effective at grinding up more weakly cemented material. 11.10 On designations of soil material between rock / pararock fragments in parent material layers 11.10.1 C C expresses properties that indicate the soil material is related to the underlying parent bedrock materials – but lacks pedogenesis, cementation and physical root-restriction. It does not imply a root limiting layer – and is considered part of the soil for classification purposes if within series control section. 11.10.2 Cd Cd implies physical root-restriction without cementation. Cd horizon only contains Densic Materials if the “bulk density or organization is such that the roots cannot enter, except in cracks.” Densic Materials have a densic contact at the depth where cracks are &gt;10cm apart. A Cd horizon could contain soil materials dense enough to restrict, but not entirely prevent, root entry into the matrix. The definition of a densic contact or statements about distance between cracks where roots can enter is rightly not invoked in definition of d suffix even though d explicitly implies some physical root-restriction. 11.10.3 Cr Cr implies weathered or soft bedrock with cementation class extremely weak to moderate. There should not be significant amounts of soil material below/within a Cr horizon, except in fractures – though I have seen Cr used in combination with soil horizons with a virgule (e.g BCt / Cr) in extreme cases – such a construct is hard to interpret over. A Cr horizon contains paralithic materials when roots cannot enter the cemented materials, except in cracks. The upper boundary of a Cr layer usually is, but doesn’t have to be, a root-limiting layer. The implication of a root-limiting layer comes from assignment of a paralithic contact—which has the specific criterion about minimum spacing of cracks where roots can enter greater than 10cm. 11.10.4 All horizon designations For all horizon designations: The mechanism one infers for how material got to be that way is not really part assigning a designation – the designation should reflect the describer’s interpretation of soil (or nonsoil) properties observable in the field. Horizon separations should at a minimum reflect the major breaks needed for the properties you can identify as important for interpretations. However, the horizon designations themselves do not carry any taxonomic weight. For example: there are many ways in which Argillic horizons can accumulate clay. In general terms, we often suggest the mechanism is lessivage – that clay is vertically translocated in the profile. Many Argillic horizons form in part by this process, but we don’t make the process itself a distinction for the t subscript. Any evidence of pedogenic clay accumulation is enough to give it a t. If the bulk of the clay increase is due to in situ weathering, our interpretations of soil descriptions do not suffer because we thought it was lessivage in the field. For taxonomy, if the properties for an Argillic horizon are met, then there is an argillic. Guy Smith provides a good example involving Bt horizons and lamellae not necessarily constituting an Argillic ‘1.6 Basic Principles of Soil Taxonomy’, Guy Smith Interviews, p. 21. Likewise, with a d, we don’t assign taxonomic value to the process or specific parent material that caused it to be a d; what matters for interpretations is that it is a physical root-restriction. If that root-restriction is enough to warrant a densic contact and a root-limiting layer, then those features are assigned, and taxonomy will reflect it. While it is a helpful validation to compare diagnostics, restrictions and genetic horizon labels/depths – as they should generally coincide – there is no need to encode a requirement that morphologic and diagnostic horizons match within Soil Taxonomy. 11.11 On improving systems for describing the lower boundary of soil As the Keys to Soil Taxonomy say “the lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define” (p. 1) – so, in my opinion, this debate is a worthy endeavor – but we must remember the object of our study (the soil). I think there are opportunities to recognize pedogenesis where we perhaps traditionally have not, and that plays into future decisions about how to describe these soils. Dealing with the progression of “level of detail” in describing contacts over the last century of soil survey will be an ongoing problem for update work. Non-cemented bedrock materials in my area I typically designate as master horizon CB, BC or C depending on their specific properties. Usually these layers are not root-limiting – but are bedrock “rind” layers could have important pedogenic features – redoximorphic features, dense arrangement, odd texture, parafragments, etc. that are influenced by the underlying contact, as well as soil processes, – and rightly should be included above the contact to consider their effects on soil interpretations – rather than just as a gradual boundary that exists at the contact. I feel the same about Cd/Densic Contacts that we have in the mountains. These lower gradational horizons commonly overlie a paralithic contact at some depth which, by prevailing convention, essentially always coincides with the top depth of shallowest Cr if described in the pit. In the Southwest Region, we have only just begun to compete series on portions of the series control section below a paralithic contact – and as we have got more detailed about those criteria, I have seen some patterns emerging in the data for the lowest reaches of the subsoil for certain components. I need to provide specific justification for components if my restrictions / diagnostics / horizon depths don’t line up. I expect I may only get more detailed in my approach to this problem of “describing the lower boundary of the soil” over my career. While there are cases where I could imagine having my diagnostics and morphologic horizons deviate from the prevailing norm (i.e. Cr without a paralithic contact) I have never felt the need or justification to do so in a SSURGO component. Cd over Cr to portray noncemented bedrock over paralithic bedrock is technically a legitimate option I could use to portray a gradient in bedrock weathering. Likewise, I could in theory use it for dense till over bedrock – with or without densic or paralithic contacts. Those two cases would be distinguished by parent material – and taxonomically they could be identical if those parent materials did not result in meaningful differences in the taxonomic relevant quantities. 11.11.1 On bedrock age There seems to be a lot of unnecessary concern about the use of Cd on “older” bedrock but I see no harm in it being available for use. I imagine it being useful for detailed descriptions on just about any less-consolidated / less-fractured, relatively [pedogenically] unaltered, bedrock or sediments. In general, I personally have avoided Cd on bedrock – but it has been suggested to me as an option in the past. An explanation why I don’t use it is based on the rocks commonly found in my area – which are highly fractured – significantly influencing weathering patterns and potential pedogenesis. If a layer containing non-cemented bedrock is so weathered that it no longer reflects original volumetric relationships in the parent rock (i.e. the visible rock fabric has become “denser,” or large portions have been altered/removed, but elements of it are still present) it has generally weathered enough, to be considered a soil material (rather than parent material) in the profile proper. It may locally contain significant amounts of pararock fragments, but it is too pedogenically altered and too penetrable by roots to be densic or paralithic materials per their definitions. There are volumes primarily of highly weathered soil material mixed with non-cemented in-situ weathered rock, cemented rock, clay films on various surfaces, etc. In the field, I usually assume that roots can get into/through such non-cemented, pedogenically altered bedrock layers when there is water to be had — so I treat them as soil horizons, and have no contact above that depth. I commonly have evidence of roots present in enough quantity up to the actual contact. 11.11.2 Densic Materials that are not relatively dense The case allowed in Densic Materials, where non-cemented material does not have to be “dense” but only “resistant,” is unusual to me. It sounds like it is intended to account for something more like a “strongly contrasting density” rather than “dense”– but both are included within one “material” definition. The argument in favor of this is that the net result of either case a common criterion: root-restriction to just cracks (and, in most cases, also a root-limiting layer where those cracks are far enough apart). If the diagnostic features for a soil reflect the presence/absence of root-limiting layers that are needed for classification, I have no problem with whatever the horizon designations may be in the field. 11.11.3 On the concept of cracks or fractures in weathered granitoid grus Having many-meters thick materials, without lithic, paralithic and/or densic contacts is real phenomenon on some areas of deeply weathered granitoid bedrock of the Sierra Nevada – per Dr. O’Geen’s commentary. In my opinion, the concept of a “crack” or “fracture” is truly ill defined for the purposes of granitoid “grus.” - as well as probably many other types of rocks that have planes of weakness. These rocks have plenty of macroscopic fractures in them – but also due to their mineral composition (e.g. mica weathering to vermiculite) also exhibit extensive grain-scale “fracturing,” making them inherently more penetrable to water and roots than their unweathered counterparts – further compounding the weathering process. While interesting, and relevant to land use and management in these forested areas of the Sierra Nevada that in some cases have experienced significant tree mortality and fire the greater depths are [presently] beyond the scope of Soil Taxonomy and routine soil survey. 11.11.4 Extending the series control section, optional phase criteria? The series control section extends 25cm beyond a paralithic or densic contact, or about 200 cm, whichever is shallower. There is probably an opportunity for capturing deeper vadose zone features in e.g. optional family level classes and/or special extensions to the series control section, or a new “phase control section” as well as perhaps new horizon designations – rather than confusing re-statements of existing concepts.

I support the addition of these subgroups in limited circumstances, but I have several points I would like to see clarified pertaining to: master horizon designation logic, organic carbon thresholds, minimum thickness for Thapto-Humic criterion #2, Great Groups/spatial extent affected and relative position within Subgroup-level Keys. 12.2 Master Horizon Designation Logic There is a strong historical precedent for keeping horizon designation logic out of the Keys. Relying on diagnostic horizons, and then secondarily on related properties, is the way to go. Buried, dark-colored horizons (moist value &lt;= X; Holocene OC &gt; Y) is descriptive enough of the soil materials being classified – though I wonder about including a dry value requirement to enhance estimation of OC from color. A dark colored, carbon-rich “C” horizon, that perhaps was not identified as a “buried A” specifically, should classify the same as an Ab horizon – if it meets the color and carbon requirements. Mollic subgroups in the Xeralfs use similar less-restrictive-than-epipedon color and carbon criteria – with no limitations on horizon designations comprising the interval of interest. The revisions I request for this point are minor: Proposed: Thapto-Humic: Soils with one or both of the following: 1. Have a buried layer that meets criteria for a Histic, Mollic, Umbric, or Melanic epipedon within 200 cm of the soil surface; or 2. Combined thickness of all buried O and dark colored A horizons (moist value ≤3) with ≥1.0% Holocene age organic carbon, is 20 cm or more thick within 200 cm of the soil surface. (See Figs. 2,3) 12.3 Justification for organic carbon threshold &amp; cumulative thickness in Thapto-Humic criterion 2 I want to see justification for use of organic carbon content greater than 1.0% and cumulative thickness &gt;20cm. Explain why 1% rather than, for instance, the minimum value required for the various mineral epipedons (0.6%) or Fluv* (0.2/0.3%). I understand it may need to be higher – but explain why. Is there a potential gap between criterion 1 and criterion 2 for Thapto-Humic as a result of a different carbon criteria? Same carbon content threshold as epipedon would better capture the things that didn’t meet criteria for an epipedon. And would reflect more storage than Fluv* – though that would be better captured with carbon stock calculation like the Humults. Less thresholds to remember – we already have too many as it is – see Mollic Haploxeralfs [0.7], for instance and differences between Fluv subgroups. Would 1% threshold work as well in all systems (i.e. in hotter, drier climates; non-Aquic SMR; non-Aquic soil moisture subclass)? Currently Thapto-Histic are limited to Entisols and Aquolls – which narrows their scope considerably to landforms where carbon is naturally elevated. I would like to see data and examples from less-wet areas used in developing the OC and thickness thresholds (if the scope is being expanded out of wet/floodplain soils). Much of the authors justification for the changes/examples are in floodplains, so I imagine they primarily want to these concepts for those areas. 12.4 Great Groups The authors mention four orders (Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Andisols) – but all the series-level examples are Aquic or Udic. I think to be complete a proposal needs to point out specifically where within the key to subgroups of each Great Group these criteria will be inserted. This is necessary for regions to be able to properly evaluate the impact of this proposal on their area of responsibility. 12.5 Impact of proposed changes Authors give some information on extent of currently mapped Thapto-Histic, but do not estimate how much extent will increase. If new taxa were limited to certain moisture regimes (i.e. where you have examples/data) then this question is a bit more tractable. Based on the examples given, and lack of constraints on where they will be added in the Key, the increase could be very significant – but possibly hard to characterize due to the uncertainty in properties &gt;100cm depth (in existing datasets). The Thapto-Humic could potentially be even more extensive than Thapto-Histic as it does not require organic soil materials, buried diagnostic features or vertical continuity of organic-rich layers. 12.6 Relative order of Subgroup Keys RE: adding new taxa “before Fluventic or Fluvaquentic criteria” I think it is important that you specify where these taxa will be added in each Subgroup Key, for each Great Group. For instance, in the Haplocryolls subgroup key (p220, KST 12th ed), Andic/Vitrandic, Aquic Cumulic and Cumulic key out before Fluvaquentic. Soils meeting Thapto-Humic and Thapto-Histic likely would key out as something-Cumulic if subgroups were added before Fluvaquentic. Fluvaquentic keys out before Aquic, Oxyaquic, Calcic Pachic, and Pachic – which all precede Fluventic. The placement of these new taxa with respect to soil moisture (sub)classes is critically important, based on authors own explanations. One could make an argument for putting Thapto* after Vertic – but there are several taxa that could be in use already, capturing related properties in the places where these new taxa would occur. Thapto-Histic: thick (&gt;40cm) buried organic soil materials Thapto-Humic: buried organic-rich soil materials (&gt;20cm cumulative thickness) Andic/Vitrandic: low bulk density/ashy surface Aquic Cumulic/Fluvaquentic/Aquic: Aquic Conditions within 100cm Cumulic/Fluventic: slope &lt;25%: irregular decrease in Holocene-age organic carbon Pachic/Cumulic: thick dark surface "],

(2020/06/19) The author highlights the arbitrary division of control section concepts for Histosols and Histels based on moss fiber content and or bulk density &lt;0.1g/cc. While these criteria historically had a clear intent, they can be challenging to evaluate in the field – and even more challenging to evaluate for database records where important information about soil composition/fabric may be missing. The author proposes: eliminating the “bottom tier,” uniform 0 - 60cm interval for the “surface tier” control section bottom depths uniform at 130cm – implying a “subsurface tier” from 60 to 130cm (or other limit on depth). I think that there is a need for clarifying logic currently found on p 25 and 26 in KST 12th edition – which is difficult to follow. Even if these proposals are not accepted as-is, I hope that the author can contribute some better wording for the new version of the keys to enhance consistency of application of current criteria. I generally support the elimination of fiber-based criteria for the control section, as we already have taxa at a higher level in the Keys (e.g. Sphagnofibrists) that capture the more-extreme cases of these soils – so capturing it again in the family / control section keys seems somewhat redundant. 13.2 More examples needed That said, I think we need more examples and information of how these will affect existing series concepts/mapping and separation of distinct taxonomic concepts at higher order. Unfortunately, data on Histosols is affected by historic priorities that the author identified in proposal. 13.3 Impacts on Region 2 NASIS Pedons I started off by pulling all the Histosol descriptions we have in NASIS for Region 2. I wrote a calculation evaluate whether the 30cm or 60cm surface tier depth will apply for each profile. The key property of interest to surface tier determination is fibric soil materials. As the author mentions, it is challenging to evaluate “moss fiber content” and bulk density – and those determinations are prone to some error/subjectivity. For a soil to have the 60cm thick surface tier under old rules, it must be fibric throughout all soil horizons in that 0 - 60cm depth – and &gt;75% of those organic fibers must be moss or have bulk density &lt; 0.1 g/cc. This means that based on fibric materials alone we can estimate an upper boundary of effects of changing surface tier criteria. We will identify fibric by simply looking for lieutex of “spm” or “peat” or an “i” suffix in horizon designations in upper 60cm. If the horizons are not fibric, the composition of fibers and density are irrelevant. They will not get the Sphagno* control section. What I found is that some 85% (n = 230) of Histosols in NASIS for R02 currently use the 30cm surface tier depth. Therefore, under this proposal, these soils would see a thickening of their surface tier to 60cm. This is, to me, more of a “problem” than changing the control section bottom depth from 160 to 130cm or eliminating bottom tier. The near-surface properties strike me as more important, inherently, and this is corroborated by the authors suggestions about typical rooting depth etc. It seems that more consideration is needed to see whether it is acceptable for all “non-Sphagno” Histosols to have double the surface tier thickness. At first blush this proposal appears to introduce a “simplification” for relatively rare or localized Sphagno soils – but it winds up having a disproportionate effect on everything else in the Histosols by increasing the surface tier thickness. Retaining 30cm would be more consistent with historic taxonomy – but it seems that the author was in favor of 60cm based on native plant rooting depths. I don’t dispute that as valid logic – it is just different from what we are doing “most” of the time. [EDIT: This is actually rarely diagnostic or required series criteria, per Dan Wing’s comments to the committee] Approximately 12% (n = 33) of R02 Histosols have a control section bottom depth of 160cm. In approximately 30% (n = 189) of R02 Histosols, a root-limiting layer is present that truncates the control section to a depth less than 130cm. Therefore, the bottom depth of control section is less affected by this proposal than the surface tier bottom depth in R02. In most R02 Histosols the surface tier will be doubling in thickness. However determination of reaction class would be limited to just the surface tier, as opposed to whole control section. This will potentially lead to changes in series concepts but reduces the thickness of materials that are relevant to determining organic soil reaction class – bringing those materials closer to surface. This should both make data collection / inference easier as well as, hypothetically, taxonomic changes more relevant to interpretations. I think that the potential benefits of the simplifications proposed here potentially outweigh the issues that typically will come with redefining a control section. Unlike particle size control sections for mineral soils, the Histosol tier depths were “arbitrary” and not dramatically affected by specific diagnostic feature depths. However, the minimal amount of historic data / focus on these soils dramatically complicates their potential re-correlation. If we are to collect more data on these soils, as I think we will… it might be good to get these concepts figured out before that due to the implications for sampling protocol. 13.4 Question: about replacing subsurface tier It isn’t made clear how the subsurface tier related criteria in the various Histosols keys would be replaced with a single depth of 100cm. Or why 100cm? Further, I am not sure why the subsurface tier needs to be removed from these criteria. It seems a now-more-consistent concept of a subsurface tier should still be used on p167, p171, p 172 etc. The subsurface tier would be the portion of the control section below 60cm and above 130cm (or RLL). An evaluation at a single depth (100cm; intersects only one horizon) is different from an evaluation over an interval (i.e. evaluate all layers within the subsurface tier), and 100cm is a foot or more shallower than historic criteria that may be meaningful (e.g. occurrence of mineral soil material within subsurface tier). Why have the control section to 130cm, if we will use 100cm in the key? If you want those evaluations to only go to 100cm (I could imagine practical reasons why) then why not propose that we limit the control section too? I pretty sure I would NOT support that – but regardless, 100cm needs more justification considering the rest of proposal. 13.5 Comments on reaction class I broadly support separating calcareous fens from euic/dysic – but I think some of the other criteria in that proposal need work. That work is dependent on how this proposal is re-structured. 13.6 Final comments I support the spirit of these changes – with the caveat that there may be significant changes in the surface tier thickness that may cause correlation issues. However, per Dan Wing’s clarification, he reviewed all series correlated the Histosols and did not encounter cases where this would cause significant conflict with the range in characteristics. There probably are “issues” with our current taxonomic model for Histosols that we can inform with modern analyses – and make future work more productive. The specific effects on mapping/taxa cannot be evaluated based on this proposal alone – as simultaneous changes to reaction class have been proposed – and the data available to support some of these concepts in the databases are sparse.
