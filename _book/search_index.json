I see no inherent issue with these taxa and defer to folks more familiar with mapping needs in AK to determine whether adding these taxa would “help” – especially considering that Gelolls currently have very low mapped acreage and require things e.g. dolomitic parent material for their pattern of occurrence. I could imagine the base status and other properties to be ecologically significant – which would, in my mind, justify the use of the new taxa – even if rare. I support this proposal if the committee agrees. 6.2 Skeletal, cryic inclusions in a “gelic landscape?” I wonder whether with the amount of sand/fragments/high thermal conductivity materials some of these are cryic inclusions in a “gelic landscape.” It seems the authors have thought about that. I trust the professors who are on the paper and proposal to have given this idea at least a fair shake. They did exclude some sites from “gelic” in their paper. Not sure how feasible it would be to instrument these soils to “prove” they are gelic – I can imagine it being a nightmare. "]
